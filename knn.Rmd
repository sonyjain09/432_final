## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

data <- read.csv("caravan.csv")

train_data <- subset(data, ORIGIN == "train")
test_data <- subset(data, ORIGIN == "test")
train_data <- subset(train_data, select = -c(ORIGIN))
test_data <- subset(test_data, select = -c(ORIGIN))
test_data
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
install.packages("class")  
library(class) 
train_features <- subset(train_data, select = -c(CARAVAN))  # Exclude target variable
train_labels <- train_data$CARAVAN 
train_features_scaled <- scale(train_features)

knn_result <- knn(train = train_features_scaled, test = validation_features_scaled, 
                  cl = train_labels, k = 3)
table(Predicted = knn_result, Actual = validation_labels)  # Confusion matrix

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy <- sum(knn_result == validation_labels) / length(validation_labels)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
